# 1.1 Product Strategy
A comprehensive product strategy isn’t necessary to develop a working product. It is, however, necessary to develop a product that can outcompete its rivals and which is sustainable to develop long-term. To understand what product features to prioritize, you need a strategy that allows you to identify how to maximize value for your end-users.

## 1.1.1 Product Vision
Level: `Basic`

**Your team has an explicit, high-level vision for the product(s) and/or service(s) it is responsible for. This vision clearly describes the problem that the product/service aims to solve, and was developed as a collaborative effort.**

A strong product vision emphasizes the value the product offers to users, and in-turn provides all team members with a shared understanding of the team’s long-term goal. Product visions should be validated by both team members and potential users, and revised as-needed to ensure development stays focused on creating a product that addresses a genuine customer need.

## 1.1.2 User Experience	
Level: `Basic`

**Your team evaluates how each aspect of a service’s functionality could directly or indirectly affect end-user experiences. All product design decisions reflect the need to prioritize a positive UX.**

A sub-par user experience can derail the success of an otherwise strong product. During the product formulation process, significant emphasis should be placed on ensuring that every development outcome includes user experience as a key deliverable.

## 1.1.3 ROI-Driven Prioritization
Level: `Basic`

**Your team’s product development decisions prioritize features that offer a strong Return on Investment (ROI). Assessments of a feature’s value are driven by explicit hypotheses, and whenever possible validated via consultation with customers and other stakeholders.**

ROI-driven approaches to development allow teams to ensure their priorities are aligned with the outcomes that will deliver the most value. This approach should be maintained throughout the product’s lifecycle.

## 1.1.4 Product Roadmapping
Level: `Intermediate`

**Your team uses a product roadmap to plan how its services will develop. The roadmap was created with input from all team members, and is reviewed and updated regularly.**

Roadmaps provide teams with a clear plan of action for their product. To preserve agility, teams should avoid planning too far in advance or in excessive detail; roadmaps should be regularly updated to reflect changes in the team’s needs and ensure the team stays focused on achieving key stakeholder, customer, and end-user priorities.

## 1.1.5 Product Team Organization
Level: `Intermediate`

**Your team is organized cross-functionally, and possesses all the skills and tools it needs to work on the whole product or service it’s developing.**

Teams should not be organized according to specific functions (e.g., front-end work) unless absolutely necessary. Cross-functional teams that are organized around managing a specific product are better able to set and realize priorities that maximize value for customers.

## 1.1.6 Internal Product Ownership
Level: `Advanced`

**Your team has end-to-end responsibility for developing and operating its software, and is equally comfortable performing both product development and operations activities.**

Teams with end-to-end product ownership have autonomy over the entire development process, including discovery, design, development, operations, and all other key value creation activities. Teams with product ownership are better able to find and implement opportunities to increase product value.
