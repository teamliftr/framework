# Future additions
TeamLiftr’s commitment to continuous improvement extends to the framework itself — we’re always looking to make TeamLiftr better, and want it to be as useful as possible for product engineering teams.

If you’d like to help with the development of TeamLiftr, we’d love to hear from you. Here are some ways to get involved:

   - **Provide Feedback** by [opening an issue](https://github.com/teamliftr/framework/issues/new) in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/teamliftr/framework).
   - **Propose a Change** by [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/teamliftr/framework/pulls). 
   - **Join Our Community** by signing up to the [TeamLiftr Community on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/teamliftr/shared_invite/zt-17s1ssb6b-1~k1AzVajRxCxbJHxqMpRw).

## Suggested Metrics
We are currently developing a suite of suggested metrics for the Framework. Each metric will be linked to a specific topic from the assessments, and will be designed as a way for teams to measure the progress of their improvement projects.
        
These metrics will make it easier for teams to assess the effects of their improvement efforts with confidence. When teams have concrete “proof” that their efforts are having a positive effect, they are more likely to stay committed to them long-term.   
           
Providing suggested metrics should also make the framework more actionable: The “action threshold” for starting a new improvement project should be lower if teams know that they don’t have to spend time developing their own KPI, and can instead rely on using a TeamLiftr-validated performance metric to assess their progress. 

## Usage standards and guidance
We are investigating whether the creation of a formal set of usage guidelines would be beneficial to our users. These usage guidelines would collectively serve as a flexible standard that teams could use to guide their ongoing, long-term use of the framework. 
           
This usage guidance would be focused on high-level activities, such as: engaging with assessments, performing team reviews, selecting improvement priorities, creating new improvement projects, etc.             
              
Teams often have trouble assessing whether they are doing “enough” when pursuing an improvement goal, and this uncertainty can have a negative impact on motivation. By enabling teams to assess their overall use of the Framework against a set of TeamLiftr-validated guidelines, we can provide teams with the ability to more confidently assess whether their current efforts are  are sufficient to meet their overall goals.
