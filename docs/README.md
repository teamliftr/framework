## Introduction
*TL;DR* 
TeamLiftr is an assessment and performance tracking framework that provides a structured, straightforward way for software product teams to assess their own performance. Teams can use the framework to efficiently identify which work areas they feel should be prioritized for improvement. 
---
We developed TeamLiftr to meet our own need for a framework that offers a high-level overview of team performance. Teams we work with have been able to use the framework to identify improvement opportunities they would otherwise miss, and have found it to simplify the process of selecting and onboarding new improvement projects. 

The framework's design and content reflect current best practices in software engineering and assessment design, and the framework as a whole has been validated by outside exports. While the framework aims to be comprehensive, it is ultimately a subjective and non-exhaustive document that reflects the perspectives of its creators. 

This “curatorial” approach to creating TeamLiftr separates it from frameworks that are based on survey or interview feedback. These approaches are valuable, but they also pass-on any feedback blindspots. Our approach allows us to ensure that we address important areas that survey-based methods could miss.

The TeamLiftr framework is complemented by the TeamLiftr app (TeamLiftr.com). The app includes all three TeamLiftr assessments, visualizations of both individual and team-level assessment feedback, progress tracking tools, and dedicated collaborative workspaces for each of your team’s improvement projects. 

The framework itself will always be free. The app provides an optional way for teams to keep their entire improvement journey within a single platform so that their improvement workflows are more streamlined, trackable, and transparent.
