## Introduction

TeamLiftr is an assessment and performance tracking framework designed to allow software product teams to self-assess their overall performance. We developed TeamLiftr to meet our own need for a framework that provides a structured, high-level overview of the key areas that most impact team performance. 

TeamLiftr was built specifically to provide software product teams with a straightforward structure for identifying and pursuing opportunities to improve team performance. We use it with the teams we work with, and have found it to be consistently effective.

Due to the framework’s comprehensive, multi-category focus, it can serve as a valuable source of inspiration for teams who are looking to identify new opportunities for improvement. Teams that assess themselves using the framework can identify improvement opportunities that otherwise would have gone unnoticed.  

The design and content of the TeamLiftr framework has been written to reflect current industry-recognized best practices; however, this framework is inherently subjective and non-exhaustive: TeamLiftr’s authors relied upon their own professional experience, followed by reviews from outside experts, in order to maximize the framework’s relevance to teams. 

This approach contrasts with frameworks that are designed based on interviews and survey feedback. We departed from this approach in order to avoid conflating an issue’s salience with its importance to performance—by relying on our own professional experience and validation from outside experts, we can ensure that TeamLiftr’s scope is comprehensive enough to cover all major performance issues.   

The TeamLiftr framework is complemented by the TeamLiftr app (TeamLiftr.com), an optional premium platform for the TeamLiftr framework. The app includes all three TeamLiftr assessments, custom visualizations for both user and team-level assessment results, progress tracking tools, and dedicated workspaces for each of your improvement projects. 

The TeamLiftr framework will always be free, our goal for TeamLiftr.com is to provide a way for teams to keep their entire improvement journey within a single platform in order to make your improvement workflows simpler, easier to track, and more transparent.
