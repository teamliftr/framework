## Introduction

*Introducing TeamLiftr, a new assessment and performance tracking framework. TeamLiftr offers a structured and straightforward way for software engineering product teams to assess their performance and identify which areas they feel should be prioritized for improvement.*

We developed TeamLiftr to meet our own need for a framework that offers a high-level overview of team performance. Teams we work with have successfully used TeamLiftr to identify improvement opportunities they would otherwise miss, and have found that the Framework simplifies the process of selecting and onboarding new improvement projects. 

The Framework’s design and content reflect current best practices in software engineering and assessment design and have been validated by outside experts. While the Framework aims to be comprehensive, it is ultimately a subjective and non-exhaustive document that reflects the perspectives of its creators. 

Our ‘curatorial’ and opinionated approach to creating TeamLiftr separates it from frameworks that are designed based on survey or interview feedback. These approaches are valuable, but they also reproduce any blindspots held by survey respondents. Our approach ensures that we can address the important topics which survey-based frameworks may miss. 

The TeamLiftr framework is complemented by the TeamLiftr app ([TeamLiftr.com](https://teamliftr.com)). The app includes all three TeamLiftr assessments, visualizations of both individual and team aggregate assessment feedback, progress tracking tools, and dedicated collaborative workspaces for each of your team’s improvement projects. 

The Framework itself will always be free. The app provides an optional way for teams to keep their entire improvement journey contained within a single platform so that their improvement workflows will be more streamlined, trackable, and transparent.

## The framework's structure
TeamLiftr’s assessment framework consists of three assessments, each with four categories, each with six topics (for a total of 72 topics). The decision to limit the number of topics to 72 was made to keep the scope manageable and easy to follow, while still being comprehensive. The framework’s symmetrical 3x4x6 structure allows users to advance through the assessments and categories in any order they choose, and in lieu of completing an entire assessment at once, users may instead opt to complete the assessments in chunks, one category at a time.   

The three main assessment categories are:

**Product & Technology**      
A comprehensive product strategy isn’t necessary to develop a working product, but it is necessary to develop a product that’s competitive and sustainable. This assessment helps teams to identify what product features to prioritize and how to maximize value for end-users. 

**People & Performance**     
A strong product needs a strong team. This assessment is designed to help teams to foster an inclusive culture that values and prioritizes collaboration and continuous improvement. Every project’s performance depends on its people, and every team’s competitiveness depends on its ability to help its people improve.  

**Operations & Risk Management**     
It’s impossible to control the unexpected, but it’s not impossible to prepare for it. This assessment is designed to help teams identify whether they’re taking the necessary steps to prevent and recover from operational disruptions. Your product’s success depends on your team’s ability to prevent disruptions from occurring (and on its ability to recover when those disruptions happen anyway).

Each topic in the framework consists of a statement for users to evaluate and an explanation that provides further detail on the topic. For example, this is the first topic in the product strategy category, which is part of the Product & Technology assessment:

> **1.1.1 Product Vision**
>    - **Statement:** Your team has an explicit, high-level vision for the product(s) and/or service(s) it is responsible for. This vision clearly describes the problem that the product/service aims to solve, and was developed as a collaborative effort.**
>    - **Explanation:** A strong product vision emphasizes the value the product offers to users, and in-turn provides all team members with a shared understanding of the team’s long-term goal. Product visions should be validated by both team members and potential users, and revised as-needed to ensure development stays focused on creating a product that addresses a genuine customer need.

Users complete each topic by scoring their level of agreement with that topic's statement. The scoring system is designed to use the following format: 1 - *Untrue*, 
2 - *Somewhat True*, 3 - *Mostly True*, 4 - *Entirely True*

## How to use with your team
TeamLiftr is designed to foster continuous improvement through a cyclical process: Teams assess their performance, identify what issues to improve, and then initialize improvement projects to address each of those issues. From there, teams will use the framework to reassess their performance periodically, both to evaluate their current progress and to identify new priorities for improvement. 

The TeamLiftr process in a nutshell: Assess Performance → Identify Improvement Priority → Create Improvement Project → (Re)assess Performance. 

To get started, your team should complete at least part of an assessment—as noted above, both the assessments and their individual categories can be completed in any order. After completing an assessment, the team should review and discuss its results in order to identify its key improvement priorities.  

In order to make it easier for teams to identify their improvement priorities, TeamLiftr organizes the topics in each category according to their immediate importance:

   - **Topics 1-3** in each category are “Basic” performance topics—core performance issues that teams should prioritize first. 
   - **Topics 4-5** are “Intermediate” and Topic 6 is an “Advanced” topic—these issues are for teams that are ready to optimize their performance and out-compete their peers. 

After using an assessment to identify a particular area to improve performance in, your team should start an improvement initiative for that topic. By tying your initiative to a  specific topic from the assessment, your team will be able to monitor the initiative’s impact by tracking how assessment feedback for that topic changes over time.

This is why it’s beneficial for teams to retake assessments periodically: Using assessments to create an ongoing record of the team’s feedback makes it possible to easily and accurately monitor changes in performance over time, across all the major performance variables that are dealt with in the assessments. 

### Using TeamLiftr to decide team responsibilities
TeamLiftr is a powerful decision-making support tool that teams can use to more effectively and transparently decide who should take ownership of a given task, responsibility, or improvement initiative.

By breaking down overall team performance into organized, symmetrically-categorized arrays of individual topics, TeamLiftr can empower teams to better discuss performance issues, identify priorities, and decide who should take ownership of a given project—with significantly more clarity and transparency than would otherwise be possible. 

TeamLiftr's decision support function also applies to individuals in leadership roles: TeamLiftr has successfully been used with CTOs to help them to better decide which tasks they should manage directly and which should be delegated to others. 

### Defining routines for your team's use of TeamLiftr
Your improvement efforts are more likely to succeed if you structure them around a set of defined routines. Planning to complete one assessment per-month or setting a weekly team meeting to review the progress of your improvement projects are just two routine events that can add value to your efforts.  

There is no “one size fits all” approach to building routines around TeamLiftr: Your team’s routines should consist of whatever events and processes are convenient to fit into its existing workflow. Structuring the team’s improvement efforts around explicit routines will make those efforts more impactful and increase the team’s ability to generate sustained performance improvement. 

### Getting the most out of post-assessment discussions 
The discussions that your team has about the TeamLiftr framework are just as important as the assessments themselves, and provide an opportunity for team members to review results, share insights, and develop a plan of action. When used to their full potential, these post-assessment discussions can collectively act as an invaluable shared record of the team’s overall performance improvement efforts.     
    
*Identify Potential Improvement Projects*   
Identifying which areas of your team’s performance should be prioritized can be challenging; however, the TeamLiftr framework makes this process far more straightforward. By breaking down your team’s performance into 12 discrete categories, with six topics per-category, TeamLiftr offers an organized, easy-to-discuss snapshot of team performance. The framework can’t tell your team what its specific goals should be, but it can provide the structure necessary for teams to develop that answer themselves. 

*Inspire Meaningful Discussions*     
TeamLiftr’s post-assessment discussions are an opportunity for individual team members to highlight issues they feel strongly about. Each topic in the Framework is a potential “jumping off” point that team members can use to highlight an issue they feel deserves more awareness within the team. 

It can be difficult to direct a group’s attention to issues that they don’t view as important—post-assessment discussions ensure that all team members have the agency to prevent key issues from being overlooked.

*Facilitate Knowledge Sharing*   
Group discussion of assessment results should encourage the exchange of perspectives between team members and provide opportunities for team members to build a shared understanding of a topic. Knowledge sharing during discussions is an improvement activity unto itself—one that can help teams to recognize when improving their knowledge of a specific topic area should become a formal improvement initiative in its own right.  

*Create Topic Breakdowns*   
TeamLiftr deals with performance at a relatively high-level. To fully discuss a topic from the framework, it will often be necessary to consider the various factors that affect your team’s performance in that area. This topic breakdown process is important when planning your improvement projects: The ability to target specific performance variables is a crucial part of goal setting.

*Reinforce Existing Achievements*   
For teams that routinely update their TeamLiftr assessments, post-assessment discussions are a valuable knowledge management activity. For example, team discussions about changes in assessment results are an effective way to identify if refresher training is necessary, or if there has been a breakdown in skill transfer somewhere. Being able to identify these issues is crucial to ensure that your team’s hard-won performance improvements will be retained long-term.

## Ambitions / Future Additions to the Framework
**Suggested Metrics**      
We are currently developing a suite of suggested metrics for the Framework. Each metric will be linked to a specific topic from the assessments, and will be designed as a way for teams to measure the progress of their improvement projects.
        
These metrics will make it easier for teams to assess the effects of their improvement efforts with confidence. When teams have concrete “proof” that their efforts are having a positive effect, they are more likely to stay committed to them long-term.   
           
Providing suggested metrics should also make the framework more actionable: The “action threshold” for starting a new improvement project should be lower if teams know that they don’t have to spend time developing their own KPI, and can instead rely on using a TeamLiftr-validated performance metric to assess their progress. 

**Usage Standards & Guidance**        
We are investigating whether the creation of a formal set of usage guidelines would be beneficial to our users. These usage guidelines would collectively serve as a flexible standard that teams could use to guide their ongoing, long-term use of the framework. 
           
This usage guidance would be focused on high-level activities, such as: engaging with assessments, performing team reviews, selecting improvement priorities, creating new improvement projects, etc.             
              
Teams often have trouble assessing whether they are doing “enough” when pursuing an improvement goal, and this uncertainty can have a negative impact on motivation. By enabling teams to assess their overall use of the Framework against a set of TeamLiftr-validated guidelines, we can provide teams with the ability to more confidently assess whether their current efforts are  are sufficient to meet their overall goals.
