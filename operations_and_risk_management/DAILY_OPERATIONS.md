# 3.1 Daily Operations
Even the best-laid plans can go awry if they are not supported by strong day-to-day work practices. The use of defined workflow processes and frameworks that can be used to monitor and benchmark both daily and near-term productivity is a necessity for any team that wants to be able to meaningfully track changes in their performance over time.

## 3.1.1 Planning Accuracy
**Your team is effective at estimating how much work/effort will need to be done to complete a task, and avoids committing to tasks it does not have time to do.**

Planning accuracy can be measured as the ratio between work planned and work delivered. A ratio below 70% usually indicates overcommitment, while a ratio above 95% may indicate undercommitment. Elite teams operate in the 90 - 95% range.

## 3.1.2 Time Management
**Your team treats time management skills as core team and individual competencies. Time management skills are discussed regularly and are steadily improving.**

Effective time management practices enable teams to identify time wastes, locate efficiencies, and reduce stress. Strong time management techniques will consider both how much time a task should take to complete and how much energy/effort will need to be while completing that task.

## 3.1.3 Meeting Productivity
**Your team’s meetings are productive, useful, and not done just “because”. All team members are active participants during meetings and contribute items to meeting agendas.**

Regular meetings are important; however, they can be a burden if they become too frequent or long. Effective meetings have explicit goals, and are scheduled to respect the team’s existing workflows. Teams should also intermittently review their approach to meetings in order to ensure that it remains efficient and useful.

## 3.1.4 Development Capacity
**Your team’s development capacity is adequate for the present and long term needs of the products and services that it is working on.**

A team with adequate capacity can service both its development and operational needs throughout the lifespan of its product. To maintain adequate capacity, teams must continuously monitor their current capacity against their needed capacity and efficiently upscale when needed.

## 3.1.5 Team Workflow	
**Your team’s workflow events and processes are performing adequately, and performance is assessed at regular intervals (e.g., at the end of milestones).	**

“Team processes” are the agreed-upon actions and interactions that a team takes to achieve a shared goal. Events are part of processes, and include stand-ups and retrospectives. In order to ensure your team’s “way of working” is continuing to function well, it is important to review your team’s workflow processes regularly.

## 3.1.6 Internal Role Clarity
**Everyone on the team understands what each other’s roles and responsibilities are. This ensures that all key outcomes receive adequate attention throughout development.**

Self-organizing teams have the agility to adjust roles as necessary to confront new challenges; however, this can lead to a loss of role clarity within the team. The use of team retrospectives and other reflection activities is necessary to ensure that teams maintain a shared understanding of each member’s responsibilities.
